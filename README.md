1. **Table Creation and Data Insertion**: Three tables (`Student`, `Course`, and `Enrollment`) are created to store information about students, courses, and their enrollments. Data is inserted into these tables, including student details, course details, and enrollment records.

2. **Basic Queries on Students**: Queries are performed to retrieve all students, filter students based on their department (`CSE`), and list students older than 20 in descending order of age. Additionally, the number of students in each department is counted.

3. **Joining Tables for Insights**: The `Enrollment`, `Student`, and `Course` tables are joined to extract information like student names, courses, and their marks. 

4. **Aggregations and Filtering**: The average marks for each course are calculated, students with marks greater than 80 are identified, and the total courses each student has enrolled in are counted.
